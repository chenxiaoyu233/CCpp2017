you could use up, down, left, right to move the character witch is presented by the symbol '@'.
the symbol '#' shows the wall and the character cannot go through it.
when you meet some special symbol, such as '%', '*', they are actually the portal and you could press the botton 'x' to go through the portal.

#inportant# when you see the symbol '^', that is the gate for you to leave, which means you could win the game.

that's it. 
have fun...
